## Problem Statement

You need to write a program that prints the numbers that:

1. If the number is a multiple of 3, you need to print "Fizz" instead of that number.
2. If the number is a multiple of 5, you need to print "Buzz" instead of that number.
3. If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, you need to print "FizzBuzz" instead of that number.

Try to think of a solution to solve this challenge with the help of loops and conditional statements before moving to the solution.
