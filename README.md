# AlgorithmJS - Learning Algorithms in JavaScript

This repository contains examples of various algorithms implemented in JavaScript. The algorithms are intended to help you improve your understanding of different problem-solving techniques and data structures.

## Getting Started

To run the tests for the algorithms, you need to have Jest installed. If you haven't installed it yet, run the following command:

```
npm install jest --save-dev
```

## Running the Tests

You can execute the tests for each algorithm using the following command:

```
npx jest <test_file_name>.js
```

Replace `<test_file_name>` with the name of the test file for the specific algorithm you want to test.

## Contributing

If you have any additional algorithms you would like to include or have found any issues with the existing code, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Your contributions are most welcome!

Happy learning and happy coding!
